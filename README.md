# Module 5 Challenge

## Overview
This challenge's purpose was to get us practicing more complex data manipulation techniques like `groupby`, `pivot_table`, and `resample`.  Using these methods, we were able to display data that could potentially be impactful for an organization that is looking to ascertain their sales as well as define future investment in specific product lines.

## Code Details
This challenge has two main components:  
1. The `athletic_sales_analysis_starter_code` Jupyter Notebook
2. The two CSVs in the "Resources" folder containing 2020 and 2021 pertinent data.
